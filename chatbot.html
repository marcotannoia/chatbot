      <p class="info-text">
        I'm Marco Tannoia, an Italian Computer & Automation Engineering student.
        I like building real projects, experimenting with AI, cloud technologies
        and automation, and seeing how modern platforms fit together.
        I have been studying and working with cloud technologies recently and i got really
        interested. This is my first serverless project.
        Enjoy it!

      <h2 class="info-title">WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?</h2>
      <p class="info-text">
        This chatbot is my first serverless project. I created it to learn,
        experiment and understand how a fully scalable cloud application works. How does it work?

      <p class="info-text">
        Simply type a message and the bot will respond using AI-generated text.

      <h2 class="info-title">DIFFICULTIES I FACED & HOW IT WAS BUILT</h2>

      <p class="info-text">
        This project uses:
      </p>

      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>Amazon S3 for hosting the frontend</li>
        <li>Amazon CloudFront for global HTTPS delivery</li>
        <li>Amazon Cognito for user authentication, which guarantees secure access</li>
        <li>AWS API Gateway (HTTP API) to receive chat messages</li>
        <li>AWS Lambda to run the serverless backend</li>
        <li>Gemini Free Tier Model for AI responses</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="info-text"> 
        I faced many difficulties, especially with finding AI API which was easy to use and free to start with. 
        <p class="info-text">
        I finally settled on Gemini Free Tiar Model, which provides a free tier and a variety of model, it has some limitations
        , such as a limited number of tokens per request, but for this project it works well.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text">    
        Another challenge was setting up the AWS services to work together, especially Cognito and API Gateway, and the fact
        that Cognito requires HTTPS, which meant setting up CloudFront in front of S3.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text">
        The frontend was built totally by ChatGPT, I just gave it some instructions and it generated the HTML, CSS and JS code for me.
        Also I asked ChatGPT to help me with facing some issues I had while creating the overall architecture of the project. 
        Nonetheless, I had to debug and modify the code myself to make everything work as I wanted, since ChatGPT sometimes generates code that doesn't work as expected.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text">
        Overall, it was a great learning experience and I'm happy with the result!
